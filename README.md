# scala-cflow
Some control structure written in scala. 

Currently, it just contains a class named `'woshilaiceshide.cflow.line.Line[R]'` to let you write asynchronous logics in a synchronous way. An example is shown on https://github.com/woshilaiceshide/scala-cflow/blob/master/src/test/scala/woshilaiceshide/cflow/test/LineExample.scala.
